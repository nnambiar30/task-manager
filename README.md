# Task Manager GraphQL API with Go, gqlgen, and Gin

## Abstract

This project is a high-performance task management system built using Go, gqlgen, and Gin. It leverages GraphQL to create a flexible and efficient API. The project is designed as a fun learning experience to help me master Golang, gain practical GraphQL API development skills, and explore modern backend system design and cloud deployment practices.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:
- **Learn Golang:** Deepen my understanding of Goâ€™s simplicity, performance, and concurrency features.
- **Build a GraphQL API:** Gain hands-on experience with GraphQL using gqlgen, enabling efficient data fetching and a strongly typed schema.
- **Explore Backend System Design:** Create a robust, scalable backend that integrates with a modern web framework (Gin) and containerization (Docker).
- **Have Fun Learning:** Engage in a challenging yet enjoyable project that can serve as a standout addition to your portfolio.

## Motivation

This project will allow you to:
- Deepend my proficiency in modern backend technologies.
- Design and implement a flexible and efficient API.
- Work with industry-standard tools like Docker, JWT, and cloud platforms.
- Showcase my ability to architect and deploy scalable systems.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components
- **GraphQL API Layer:**  
  Uses gqlgen to define a strongly typed schema and generate the corresponding resolver code.
- **HTTP Server Layer:**  
  Implements Gin to handle HTTP routing, including a GraphQL endpoint and a Playground for interactive testing.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  Leverages JWT for secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- **Data Storage:**  
  Integrates with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) using an ORM for persisting tasks and user data.
- **Deployment & Cloud Integration:**  
  Containerizes the application with Docker and deploys it on a cloud platform for a complete end-to-end solution.

## GraphQL Schema Design

A sample GraphQL schema for my Task Manager might look like this:

```graphql
type Task {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  completed: Boolean!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  tasks: [Task!]!
  task(id: ID!): Task
}

type Mutation {
  createTask(title: String!, description: String): Task!
  updateTask(id: ID!, title: String, description: String, completed: Boolean): Task!
  deleteTask(id: ID!): Boolean!
}
